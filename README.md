# 💧 AquaSense — Smart Water Flow Sensor

> **Revolutionizing water awareness, one drop at a time.**

AquaSense is a compact, IoT-powered flow sensor that helps users track their water usage in real time, detect leaks instantly, and gain AI-powered insights to reduce waste.  
Built to support **UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)**, AquaSense turns water awareness into measurable conservation.

---

## 🚀 Overview
AquaSense is a **non-invasive smart sensor** that clamps onto any household or facility water pipe.  
It uses ultrasonic and piezoelectric sensing to measure water flow **without cutting into plumbing**.  
All data is processed locally and synced securely to a **mobile dashboard and cloud platform** for visualization and AI-driven analysis.
